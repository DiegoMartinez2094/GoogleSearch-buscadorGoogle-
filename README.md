Google.

This project consists of the consumption of three APIS which are: Google link search, Google image search and Google translator.

First we find a moving Google logo followed by a text input bar in which you can enter the words with which you want to search, then you must press the type of search you want to do, search google links or images, for the translator section, it is not necessary to enter text.
